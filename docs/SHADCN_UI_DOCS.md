Dependencies: NextRequest, NextResponse, and an `isValidToken` function plus a `registryItem` to return on success. Limitation: `isValidToken` and `registryItem` are placeholders and must be implemented according to your auth and data models.

```typescript
// Next.js API route example
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const token = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get("token");

  if (!isValidToken(token)) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      {
        error: "Unauthorized",
        message: "Invalid or missing token",
      },
      { status: 401 }
    );
  }

  // Return the registry item
  return NextResponse.json(registryItem);
}
```

### Migrate React Component from `forwardRef` to Props

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/tailwind-v4

This example demonstrates how to refactor a React component to remove `React.forwardRef`. It shows the transformation from using `forwardRef` and `displayName` to a simpler named functional component that accepts props directly and includes a `data-slot` attribute.

```tsx
const AccordionItem = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <AccordionPrimitive.Item
    ref={ref}
    className={cn("border-b last:border-b-0", className)}
    {...props}
  />
));
AccordionItem.displayName = "AccordionItem";
```

```tsx
function AccordionItem({
  className,
  ...props
}: React.ComponentProps<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>) {
  return (
    <AccordionPrimitive.Item
      data-slot="accordion-item"
      className={cn("border-b last:border-b-0", className)}
      {...props}
    />
  );
}

### Refactor CSS Variables for @theme inline and HSL Wrappers

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/tailwind-v4

This CSS example refactors variable definitions for improved usability. It moves `hsl` wrappers to `:root` and `.dark` selectors and utilizes `@theme inline` to simplify variable access by directly referencing `--background` and `--foreground`.

```css
:root {
  --background: hsl(0 0% 100%); // <-- Wrap in hsl
  --foreground: hsl(0 0% 3.9%);
}

.dark {
  --background: hsl(0 0% 3.9%); // <-- Wrap in hsl
  --foreground: hsl(0 0% 98%);
}

@theme inline {
  --color-background: var(--background); // <-- Remove hsl
  --color-foreground: var(--foreground);
}
```

import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod";
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
import * as z from "zod";

const formSchema = z.object({
  title: z
    .string()
    .min(5, "Bug title must be at least 5 characters.")
    .max(32, "Bug title must be at most 32 characters."),
  description: z
    .string()
    .min(20, "Description must be at least 20 characters.")
    .max(100, "Description must be at most 100 characters."),
});

export function BugReportForm() {
  const form = useForm<z.infer<typeof formSchema>>({
    resolver: zodResolver(formSchema),
    defaultValues: {
      title: "",
      description: "",
    },
  });

  function onSubmit(data: z.infer<typeof formSchema>) {
    // Do something with the form values.
    console.log(data);

This JSX snippet illustrates how to structure an array field using Shadcn's `FieldSet`, `FieldLegend`, and `FieldDescription` components. This setup provides semantic grouping and a clear description for a collection of dynamic array items.

```tsx
<FieldSet className="gap-4">
  <FieldLegend variant="label">Email Addresses</FieldLegend>
  <FieldDescription>
    Add up to 5 email addresses where we can contact you.
  </FieldDescription>
  <FieldGroup className="gap-4">{/* Array items go here */}</FieldGroup>
</FieldSet>
```

### Create Label with Checkbox Component in React/TSX

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/label

Renders an accessible label associated with a checkbox control. The Label component uses the htmlFor attribute to connect with the checkbox's id, ensuring proper accessibility. This example demonstrates basic usage with Flexbox layout and spacing utilities.

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from "@/components/ui/checkbox";
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label";

export function LabelDemo() {
  return (
    <div>
      <div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
        <Checkbox id="terms" />
        <Label htmlFor="terms">Accept terms and conditions</Label>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Calendar with Timezone Support

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/calendar

Example implementation of a calendar component with timezone awareness. Detects the user's local timezone using Intl.DateTimeFormat() in a useEffect hook during client-side rendering to avoid hydration mismatches. Passes the detected timezone to the Calendar component for proper date display and selection.

```TypeScript
export function CalendarWithTimezone() {
  const [date, setDate] = React.useState<Date | undefined>(undefined)
  const [timeZone, setTimeZone] = React.useState<string | undefined>(undefined)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    setTimeZone(Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone)
  }, [])

  return (
    <Calendar
      mode="single"
      selected={date}
      onSelect={setDate}
      timeZone={timeZone}
    />
  )
}
```

### Adjust Spinner Size with Utility Classes (TypeScript)

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/spinner

Illustrates how to change the visual size of the Spinner component using Tailwind CSS `size-*` utility classes directly via the `className` prop. This example renders multiple spinners with different predefined sizes, including `size-3`, `size-4`, `size-6`, and `size-8`. It provides a clear demonstration of how to apply various size variations to the spinner.

```tsx
import { Spinner } from "@/components/ui/spinner";

export function SpinnerSize() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-6">
      <Spinner className="size-3" />
      <Spinner className="size-4" />
      <Spinner className="size-6" />
      <Spinner className="size-8" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Understand `npm` Peer Dependency Error for React 19

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/react-19

This `npm` error output demonstrates a common `ERESOLVE` issue encountered when a package's peer dependencies do not explicitly list React 19. It indicates a conflict where the root project uses React 19 but a dependency expects an older version, leading to installation failure.

```bash
npm error code ERESOLVE
npm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
npm error
npm error While resolving: my-app@0.1.0
npm error Found: react@19.0.0-rc-69d4b800-20241021
npm error node_modules/react
npm error   react@"19.0.0-rc-69d4b800-20241021" from the root project

```tsx
import {
  Item,
  ItemContent,
  ItemDescription,
  ItemMedia,
  ItemTitle,
} from "@/components/ui/item";

export function ItemLink() {
  return (
    <Item asChild>
      <a href="/dashboard">
        <ItemMedia variant="icon">
          <Home />
        </ItemMedia>
        <ItemContent>
          <ItemTitle>Dashboard</ItemTitle>

### Complete AppSidebar with React Server Components

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/sidebar

A full implementation of a sidebar component using React Server Components that fetches project data asynchronously. The component wraps the NavProjects server component with React.Suspense to display a skeleton loader while data is being fetched. Includes project data structure with icons from lucide-react and badge counts.

```tsx
import * as React from "react"
import {
  FrameIcon,
  LifeBuoyIcon,
  MapIcon,
  PieChartIcon,
  SendIcon,
} from "lucide-react"

import {
  Sidebar,
  SidebarContent,
  SidebarGroup,
  SidebarGroupContent,
  SidebarGroupLabel,
  SidebarMenu,
  SidebarMenuButton,
  SidebarMenuItem,
  SidebarMenuSkeleton,
  SidebarProvider,
} from "@/components/ui/sidebar"

const projects = [
  {
    name: "Design Engineering",
    url: "#",
    icon: FrameIcon,
    badge: "24",
  },
  {
    name: "Sales & Marketing",
    url: "#",
    icon: PieChartIcon,
    badge: "12",
  },
  {
    name: "Travel",
    url: "#",
    icon: MapIcon,
    badge: "3",
  },
  {
    name: "Support",
    url: "#",
    icon: LifeBuoyIcon,
    badge: "21",
  },
  {
    name: "Feedback",
    url: "#",
    icon: SendIcon,
    badge: "8",
  },
]

// Dummy fetch function
async function fetchProjects() {
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000))
  return projects
}

export function AppSidebar() {
  return (
    <SidebarProvider>
      <Sidebar>
        <SidebarContent>
          <SidebarGroup>
            <SidebarGroupLabel>Projects</SidebarGroupLabel>
            <SidebarGroupContent>
              <React.Suspense fallback={<NavProjectsSkeleton />}>
                <NavProjects />
              </React.Suspense>
            </SidebarGroupContent>
          </SidebarGroup>
        </SidebarContent>
      </Sidebar>
    </SidebarProvider>
  )
}

function NavProjectsSkeleton() {
  return (
    <SidebarMenu>
      {Array.from({ length: 5 }).map((_, index) => (
        <SidebarMenuItem key={index}>
          <SidebarMenuSkeleton showIcon />
        </SidebarMenuItem>
      ))}
    </SidebarMenu>
  )
}

async function NavProjects() {
  const projects = await fetchProjects()

  return (
    <SidebarMenu>
      {projects.map((project) => (
        <SidebarMenuItem key={project.name}>
          <SidebarMenuButton asChild>
            <a href={project.url}>
              <project.icon />
              <span>{project.name}</span>
            </a>
          </SidebarMenuButton>
        </SidebarMenuItem>
      ))}
    </SidebarMenu>
  )
}

### Configure TanStack Form Validation Modes (TSX)

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/forms/tanstack-form

This example illustrates how to configure multiple validation modes within TanStack Form's `validators` option. By specifying `onSubmit`, `onChange`, and `onBlur`, validation can be triggered at different interaction points, providing flexible user feedback.

```tsx
const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: {
    title: "",
    description: "",
  },
  validators: {
    onSubmit: formSchema,
    onChange: formSchema,
    onBlur: formSchema,
  },
});
```

### Add Multiple Resources with CLI (Bash)

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/namespace

Command to add multiple resources using the CLI, showcasing how the CLI handles resolution order and deduplication. The last specified resource for a given file path will override previous ones.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @acme/auth @custom/login-form
```

### Implement Textarea with TanStack React Form and Zod Validation

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/forms/tanstack-form

This example demonstrates a complete React component (`FormTanstackTextarea`) that integrates a Shadcn UI `Textarea` with `@tanstack/react-form` for state management and Zod for validation. It showcases form submission with `sonner` toasts, dynamic error display, and reset functionality.

```tsx
/* eslint-disable react/no-children-prop */
"use client";

import { useForm } from "@tanstack/react-form";
import { toast } from "sonner";
import * as z from "zod";

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import {
  Card,
  CardContent,
  CardDescription,
  CardFooter,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
} from "@/components/ui/card";
import {
  Field,
  FieldDescription,
  FieldError,
  FieldGroup,
  FieldLabel,
} from "@/components/ui/field";
import { Textarea } from "@/components/ui/textarea";

const formSchema = z.object({
  about: z
    .string()
    .min(10, "Please provide at least 10 characters.")
    .max(200, "Please keep it under 200 characters."),
});

export function FormTanstackTextarea() {
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      about: "",
    },
    validators: {
      onSubmit: formSchema,
    },
    onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
      toast("You submitted the following values:", {
        description: (
          <pre className="bg-code text-code-foreground mt-2 w-[320px] overflow-x-auto rounded-md p-4">
            <code>{JSON.stringify(value, null, 2)}</code>
          </pre>
        ),
        position: "bottom-right",
        classNames: {
          content: "flex flex-col gap-2",
        },
        style: {
          "--border-radius": "calc(var(--radius)  + 4px)",
        } as React.CSSProperties,
      });
    },
  });

  return (
    <Card className="w-full sm:max-w-md">
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Personalization</CardTitle>
        <CardDescription>
          Customize your experience by telling us more about yourself.
        </CardDescription>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <form
          id="form-tanstack-textarea"
          onSubmit={(e) => {
            e.preventDefault();
            form.handleSubmit();
          }}
        >
          <FieldGroup>
            <form.Field
              name="about"
              children={(field) => {
                const isInvalid =
                  field.state.meta.isTouched && !field.state.meta.isValid;
                return (
                  <Field data-invalid={isInvalid}>
                    <FieldLabel htmlFor="form-tanstack-textarea-about">

                    <Textarea
                      id="form-tanstack-textarea-about"
                      name={field.name}
                      value={field.state.value}
                      onBlur={field.handleBlur}
                      onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
                      aria-invalid={isInvalid}
                      placeholder="I'm a software engineer..."
                      className="min-h-[120px]"
                    />
                    <FieldDescription>
                      Tell us more about yourself. This will be used to help us
                      personalize your experience.
                    </FieldDescription>
                    {isInvalid && (
                      <FieldError errors={field.state.meta.errors} />
                    )}
                  </Field>
                );
              }}
            />
          </FieldGroup>
        </form>
      </CardContent>
      <CardFooter>
        <Field orientation="horizontal">
          <Button type="button" variant="outline" onClick={() => form.reset()}>
            Reset
          </Button>
          <Button type="submit" form="form-tanstack-textarea">
            Save
          </Button>
        </Field>
      </CardFooter>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### Basic Card Component Usage

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/card

Demonstrates the basic structure of a Card with header, content, and footer sections. Use CardTitle for headings, CardDescription for supplementary text, and CardAction for interactive elements.

```tsx
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Card Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Card Description</CardDescription>
    <CardAction>Card Action</CardAction>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <p>Card Content</p>
  </CardContent>
  <CardFooter>
    <p>Card Footer</p>
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```

### Manage Select Component with React Hook Form

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/forms/react-hook-form

This example demonstrates how to connect a Shadcn UI `Select` component, used for choosing a billing period, to React Hook Form's `Controller`. It ensures the selected value is reflected in the form state and handles invalid states for styling.

```tsx
<Controller
  name="billingPeriod"
  control={form.control}
  render={({ field, fieldState }) => (
    <Field data-invalid={fieldState.invalid}>
      <FieldLabel htmlFor="form-rhf-complex-billingPeriod">
        Billing Period
      </FieldLabel>
      <Select
        name={field.name}
        value={field.value}
        onValueChange={field.onChange}
      >
        <SelectTrigger
          id="form-rhf-complex-billingPeriod"
          aria-invalid={fieldState.invalid}
        >
          <SelectValue placeholder="Select" />
        </SelectTrigger>
        <SelectContent>
          <SelectItem value="monthly">Monthly</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="yearly">Yearly</SelectItem>
        </SelectContent>
      </Select>
      <FieldDescription>
        Choose how often you want to be billed.
      </FieldDescription>
      {fieldState.invalid && <FieldError errors={[fieldState.error]} />}
    </Field>
  )}
/>
```

### URL Pattern with {style} Placeholder

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/namespace

Configure registries to serve different component versions based on the current style configuration. The {style} placeholder is replaced with the active style (e.g., 'new-york'). Useful for maintaining style-specific variants of components.

```json
{
  "@themes": "https://registry.example.com/{style}/{name}.json"
}
```

### Build an Accessible Form with Shadcn UI Field Components (TSX)

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/field

This TypeScript React example demonstrates how to construct a complex, accessible form using various Shadcn UI components. It combines Field, FieldGroup, FieldSet, FieldLabel, FieldDescription, Input, Select, and Checkbox to create a payment and billing information form with proper semantic structure and accessibility attributes.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Checkbox } from "@/components/ui/checkbox"
import {
  Field,
  FieldDescription,
  FieldGroup,
  FieldLabel,
  FieldLegend,
  FieldSeparator,
  FieldSet,
} from "@/components/ui/field"
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"
import {
  Select,
  SelectContent,
  SelectItem,
  SelectTrigger,
  SelectValue,
} from "@/components/ui/select"
import { Textarea } from "@/components/ui/textarea"

export function FieldDemo() {
  return (

### Embed Spinner within a Badge for Status Indication (TypeScript)

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/spinner

Illustrates the usage of a Spinner component inside a Badge to signify an ongoing process or status. This example displays several badges with different variants (default, secondary, outline), each containing a spinner and relevant text like 'Syncing' or 'Updating'. It demonstrates how to visually enhance status indicators with an animated element.

```tsx
import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/badge";
import { Spinner } from "@/components/ui/spinner";

export function SpinnerBadge() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-4 [--radius:1.2rem]">
      <Badge>
        <Spinner />
        Syncing
      </Badge>
      <Badge variant="secondary">
        <Spinner />
        Updating
      </Badge>
      <Badge variant="outline">
        <Spinner />
        Processing
      </Badge>
    </div>
  );
}

### Implement a React Select Field with Form Validation

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/forms/tanstack-form

This example showcases a `form.Field` component that renders a dropdown `Select` for choosing a billing period. It integrates with the form's state (`field.state.value`, `field.handleChange`) and displays validation errors using `FieldError` based on the `isInvalid` status, providing clear user feedback.

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="billingPeriod"
  children={(field) => {
    const isInvalid = field.state.meta.isTouched && !field.state.meta.isValid;
    return (
      <Field data-invalid={isInvalid}>
        <FieldLabel htmlFor={field.name}>Billing Period</FieldLabel>
        <Select
          name={field.name}
          value={field.state.value}
          onValueChange={field.handleChange}
          aria-invalid={isInvalid}
        >
          <SelectTrigger id={field.name}>
            <SelectValue placeholder="Select" />
          </SelectTrigger>
          <SelectContent>
            <SelectItem value="monthly">Monthly</SelectItem>
            <SelectItem value="yearly">Yearly</SelectItem>
          </SelectContent>
        </Select>
        <FieldDescription>
          Choose how often you want to be billed.
        </FieldDescription>
        {isInvalid && <FieldError errors={field.state.meta.errors} />}
      </Field>
    );
  }}
/>

### Implement Checkboxes with TanStack Form and shadcn/ui

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/forms/tanstack-form

This TypeScript/TSX example demonstrates how to integrate single and array checkboxes into a form using TanStack React Form and shadcn/ui components. It covers form initialization with `useForm`, Zod validation for both boolean and array checkboxes, handling `onCheckedChange` for state updates, displaying errors with `aria-invalid` and `data-invalid` props, and managing checkbox arrays with `mode="array"` and `tasks.map`.

```tsx

### Carousel with Spacing Configuration in React TSX

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/carousel

Implements a carousel component with configurable spacing using Tailwind CSS utilities. Uses `pl-[VALUE]` on CarouselItem and `-ml-[VALUE]` on CarouselContent to control item spacing. The example creates a responsive carousel with 5 items that displays 1 item on mobile, 2 on tablet, and 3 on desktop.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";

import { Card, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card";
import {
  Carousel,
  CarouselContent,
  CarouselItem,
  CarouselNext,
  CarouselPrevious,
} from "@/components/ui/carousel";

export function CarouselSpacing() {
  return (
    <Carousel className="w-full max-w-sm">
      <CarouselContent className="-ml-1">
        {Array.from({ length: 5 }).map((_, index) => (
          <CarouselItem key={index} className="pl-1 md:basis-1/2 lg:basis-1/3">
            <div className="p-1">
              <Card>
                <CardContent className="flex aspect-square items-center justify-center p-6">
                  <span className="text-2xl font-semibold">{index + 1}</span>
                </CardContent>
              </Card>
            </div>
          </CarouselItem>
        ))}
      </CarouselContent>
      <CarouselPrevious />
      <CarouselNext />
    </Carousel>
  );

### Integrate shadcn/ui Switch with React Hook Form Controller in TypeScript

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/forms/react-hook-form

This focused TypeScript snippet demonstrates the specific setup for connecting a `shadcn/ui` Switch component to `react-hook-form` using the `Controller` component. It illustrates how to bind `field.value` to `checked`, `field.onChange` to `onCheckedChange`, and propagate validation state using `aria-invalid` and `data-invalid` props for error visualization.

```tsx
<Controller
  name="twoFactor"
  control={form.control}
  render={({ field, fieldState }) => (
    <Field orientation="horizontal" data-invalid={fieldState.invalid}>
      <FieldContent>
        <FieldLabel htmlFor="form-rhf-switch-twoFactor">
          Multi-factor authentication
        </FieldLabel>
        <FieldDescription>
          Enable multi-factor authentication to secure your account.
        </FieldDescription>
        {fieldState.invalid && <FieldError errors={[fieldState.error]} />}
      </FieldContent>
      <Switch
        id="form-rhf-switch-twoFactor"
        name={field.name}
        checked={field.value}
        onCheckedChange={field.onChange}
        aria-invalid={fieldState.invalid}
      />
    </Field>
  )}
/>

### Create Basic Command Menu Dialog with Keyboard Shortcut (⌘K) in React (Shadcn UI)

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/command

The `CommandMenu` component provides a simpler command dialog activated by pressing `⌘K` (or `Ctrl+K`). It uses Shadcn UI's `CommandDialog`, `CommandInput`, `CommandList`, `CommandEmpty`, and `CommandGroup` to display a basic list of suggestions. The component manages its open state via `useState` and sets up a global keyboard event listener using `useEffect`.

```tsx
export function CommandMenu() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const down = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
      if (e.key === "k" && (e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey)) {
        e.preventDefault();
        setOpen((open) => !open);
      }
    };
    document.addEventListener("keydown", down);
    return () => document.removeEventListener("keydown", down);
  }, []);

  return (
    <CommandDialog open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen}>
      <CommandInput placeholder="Type a command or search..." />
      <CommandList>
        <CommandEmpty>No results found.</CommandEmpty>
        <CommandGroup heading="Suggestions">
          <CommandItem>Calendar</CommandItem>
          <CommandItem>Search Emoji</CommandItem>
          <CommandItem>Calculator</CommandItem>
        </CommandGroup>
      </CommandList>
    </CommandDialog>
  );
}
```

---

### User-Personalized Registry

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/authentication

Implement user-personalized component registries based on user preferences. Authenticates the user, retrieves their style and framework preferences, and returns personalized component versions tailored to their settings.

```typescript
async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const user = await authenticateUser(request);

  // Get user's style and framework preferences.
  const preferences = await getUserPreferences(user.id);

  // Get personalized component version.
  const component = await getPersonalizedComponent(params.name, preferences);

  return NextResponse.json(component);
}
```

### Wrap React Application with ThemeProvider in Vite

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/dark-mode/vite

This snippet illustrates how to integrate the custom `ThemeProvider` into the root layout of a React application, typically in `App.tsx`. By wrapping the main application components with `ThemeProvider`, the theme context becomes globally available, allowing any child component to consume or modify the theme. It demonstrates setting a default theme (e.g., "dark") and a storage key for persistence.

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@/components/theme-provider";

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider defaultTheme="dark" storageKey="vite-ui-theme">
      {children}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

### Configure jsconfig.json for import aliases

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/javascript

Set up the jsconfig.json file to configure path aliases for module imports. This enables using @ as an alias for the root directory, allowing cleaner import statements throughout the JavaScript project.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Implement Inset Sidebar Variant with `SidebarInset` in TSX

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/sidebar

This code demonstrates the usage of the `inset` sidebar variant, which requires wrapping the main content within a `SidebarInset` component. This ensures proper layout and spacing when the sidebar is rendered in an 'inset' style.

```tsx
<SidebarProvider>
  <Sidebar variant="inset" />
  <SidebarInset>
    <main>{children}</main>
  </SidebarInset>
</SidebarProvider>
```

---

### Implement Shadcn UI InputOTP Composition Pattern in JSX/TSX

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/input-otp

This diff illustrates how to refactor your application code to use the new composition pattern for the `InputOTP` component. It demonstrates directly nesting `InputOTPSlot` and `InputOTPSeparator` within `InputOTPGroup` as children, simplifying the component structure.

```diff
<InputOTP maxLength={6}>
  <InputOTPGroup>
    <InputOTPSlot index={0} />
    <InputOTPSlot index={1} />
    <InputOTPSlot index={2} />
  </InputOTPGroup>
  <InputOTPSeparator />
  <InputOTPGroup>
    <InputOTPSlot index={3} />
    <InputOTPSlot index={4} />
    <InputOTPSlot index={5} />
  </InputOTPGroup>
</InputOTP>
```

---

### Set JSON Schema reference

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components-json

Adds the JSON Schema reference to components.json for IDE validation and autocomplete support. This ensures the configuration file is properly validated against the shadcn/ui schema.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json"
}
```

---

### Search Registry with search Command

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli

The search command queries component registries with optional filtering. Supports searching single or multiple registries with query strings, pagination controls, and registry aliases.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest search [registry]
```

```bash
npx shadcn@latest search @shadcn -q "button"
```

```bash
npx shadcn@latest search @shadcn @v0 @acme
```

```bash
npx shadcn@latest list @acme
```

```bash
Usage: shadcn search|list [options] <registries...>

search items from registries

Arguments:
  registries             the registry names or urls to search items from. Names
                         must be prefixed with @.

### Define Global CSS Variables for Light and Dark Themes (CSS)

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming

This CSS snippet defines a comprehensive set of custom properties (CSS variables) for various UI elements, including colors for background, foreground, cards, popovers, primary/secondary/accent elements, and charts. It includes distinct definitions for both light (default) and dark themes, allowing for easy theme switching by applying the `.dark` class. These variables are typically used in a `globals.css` file to provide a consistent styling foundation across a web application, often in conjunction with UI libraries like shadcn.

```css
:root {
  --radius: 0.625rem;
  --background: oklch(1 0 0);
  --foreground: oklch(0.147 0.004 49.25);

### Define Shadcn Component with Dependency Resolution Order

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/namespace

This JSON configuration defines a dashboard component with multiple `registryDependencies`. The order of dependencies is crucial as later dependencies can override earlier ones if they target the same resource, illustrating the resolution priority.

```json
{
  "name": "dashboard",
  "registryDependencies": [
    "@shadcn/card", // 1. Resolved first
    "@vendor/chart", // 2. Resolved second
    "@custom/card" // 3. Resolved last (overrides @shadcn/card)
  ]
}
```

It further demonstrates adding a `DropdownMenu` within the header for workspace selection, utilizing `DropdownMenuTrigger`, `DropdownMenuContent`, and `DropdownMenuItem` components for interactive functionality.

```tsx
"use client";

import { ChevronDownIcon } from "lucide-react";

import {
  DropdownMenu,
  DropdownMenuContent,
  DropdownMenuItem,
  DropdownMenuTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/dropdown-menu";
import {
  Sidebar,
  SidebarHeader,
  SidebarInset,
  SidebarMenu,
  SidebarMenuButton,
  SidebarMenuItem,
  SidebarProvider,
  SidebarTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/sidebar";

export function AppSidebar() {
  return (
    <SidebarProvider>
      <Sidebar>
        <SidebarHeader>
          <SidebarMenu>
            <SidebarMenuItem>
              <DropdownMenu>
                <DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>
                  <SidebarMenuButton className="data-[state=open]:bg-sidebar-accent data-[state=open]:text-sidebar-accent-foreground">
                    Select Workspace
                    <ChevronDownIcon className="ml-auto" />
                  </SidebarMenuButton>
                </DropdownMenuTrigger>
                <DropdownMenuContent className="w-(--radix-popper-anchor-width)">
                  <DropdownMenuItem>
                    <span>Acme Inc</span>
                  </DropdownMenuItem>
                  <DropdownMenuItem>
                    <span>Acme Corp.</span>
                  </DropdownMenuItem>
                </DropdownMenuContent>
              </DropdownMenu>
            </SidebarMenuItem>
          </SidebarMenu>
        </SidebarHeader>
      </Sidebar>
      <SidebarInset>
        <header className="flex h-12 items-center justify-between px-4">
          <SidebarTrigger />
        </header>
      </SidebarInset>
    </SidebarProvider>
  );
}
```

```tsx
<Sidebar>
  <SidebarHeader>
    <SidebarMenu>
      <SidebarMenuItem>
        <DropdownMenu>
          <DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>
            <SidebarMenuButton>
              Select Workspace
              <ChevronDown className="ml-auto" />
            </SidebarMenuButton>
          </DropdownMenuTrigger>
          <DropdownMenuContent className="w-[--radix-popper-anchor-width]">
            <DropdownMenuItem>
              <span>Acme Inc</span>
            </DropdownMenuItem>
            <DropdownMenuItem>
              <span>Acme Corp.</span>
            </DropdownMenuItem>

### Implement Sidebar Menu with Navigation Items (TypeScript/React)

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/sidebar

This snippet enhances the `AppSidebar` component by adding a `SidebarMenu` with dynamic navigation items. It utilizes `SidebarGroup`, `SidebarGroupLabel`, `SidebarGroupContent`, `SidebarMenu`, `SidebarMenuButton`, and `SidebarMenuItem` to structure the menu with icons and links, demonstrating a common pattern for application navigation.

```tsx
import { Calendar, Home, Inbox, Search, Settings } from "lucide-react";

import {
  Sidebar,
  SidebarContent,
  SidebarGroup,
  SidebarGroupContent,
  SidebarGroupLabel,
  SidebarMenu,
  SidebarMenuButton,
  SidebarMenuItem,
} from "@/components/ui/sidebar";

// Menu items.
const items = [
  {
    title: "Home",
    url: "#",
    icon: Home,
  },
  {
    title: "Inbox",
    url: "#",
    icon: Inbox,
  },
  {
    title: "Calendar",
    url: "#",
    icon: Calendar,
  },
  {
    title: "Search",
    url: "#",
    icon: Search,
  },
  {
    title: "Settings",
    url: "#",
    icon: Settings,
  },
];

export function AppSidebar() {
  return (
    <Sidebar>
      <SidebarContent>
        <SidebarGroup>
          <SidebarGroupLabel>Application</SidebarGroupLabel>
          <SidebarGroupContent>
            <SidebarMenu>
              {items.map((item) => (
                <SidebarMenuItem key={item.title}>
                  <SidebarMenuButton asChild>
                    <a href={item.url}>
                      <item.icon />
                      <span>{item.title}</span>
                    </a>
                  </SidebarMenuButton>
                </SidebarMenuItem>
              ))}
            </SidebarMenu>
          </SidebarGroupContent>
        </SidebarGroup>
      </SidebarContent>
    </Sidebar>
  );
}

### Implement Command Dialog with Keyboard Shortcut (⌘J) in React (Shadcn UI)

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/command

This `CommandDialogDemo` component showcases a feature-rich command dialog that opens when the user presses `⌘J` (or `Ctrl+J`). It leverages several Shadcn UI components like `CommandDialog`, `CommandInput`, `CommandList`, `CommandGroup`, and `CommandItem`, along with `lucide-react` icons, managing its open state with `useState` and a global keyboard event listener via `useEffect`.

```tsx
"use client";

import * as React from "react";
import {
  Calculator,
  Calendar,
  CreditCard,
  Settings,
  Smile,
  User,
} from "lucide-react";

import {
  CommandDialog,
  CommandEmpty,
  CommandGroup,
  CommandInput,
  CommandItem,
  CommandList,
  CommandSeparator,
  CommandShortcut,
} from "@/components/ui/command";

export function CommandDialogDemo() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const down = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
      if (e.key === "j" && (e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey)) {
        e.preventDefault();
        setOpen((open) => !open);
      }
    };

    document.addEventListener("keydown", down);
    return () => document.removeEventListener("keydown", down);
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm">

This pattern follows composition principles where Recharts components remain unwrapped, allowing direct access to official upgrade paths.

```typescript
import { Bar, BarChart } from "recharts";

import { ChartContainer, ChartTooltipContent } from "@/components/ui/chart";

export function MyChart() {
  return (
    <ChartContainer>
      <BarChart data={data}>
        <Bar dataKey="value" />
        <ChartTooltip content={<ChartTooltipContent />} />
      </BarChart>
    </ChartContainer>
  );
}
```

  "registryDependencies": [
    "@vendor/auth" // Has multiple files
  ],
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "lib/auth-server.ts",

  "type": "registry:ui",
  "registryDependencies": [
    "@vendor/button" // Import original first
  ],
  "cssVars": {
    "light": {
      "--button-bg": "purple" // Override the color
    }
  }
}
```

### Add input-group tooltips (React TSX)

Source: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/input-group

Shows how to attach tooltip triggers to InputGroup buttons to provide contextual help or instructions. Depends on project Tooltip primitives, InputGroup components, and lucide-react icons. Inputs are text/password/API-key input fields; outputs are tooltip overlays. Limitations: tooltips rely on library positioning and the project's Tooltip implementation.

```tsx
import { HelpCircle, InfoIcon } from "lucide-react"\n\nimport {\n  InputGroup,\n  InputGroupAddon,\n  InputGroupButton,\n  InputGroupInput,\n} from "@/components/ui/input-group"\nimport {\n  Tooltip,\n  TooltipContent,\n  TooltipTrigger,\n} from "@/components/ui/tooltip"\n\nexport function InputGroupTooltip() {\n  return (\n    <div className="grid w-full max-w-sm gap-4">\n      <InputGroup>\n        <InputGroupInput placeholder="Enter password" type="password" />\n        <InputGroupAddon align="inline-end">\n          <Tooltip>\n            <TooltipTrigger asChild>\n              <InputGroupButton\n                variant="ghost"\n                aria-label="Info"\n                size="icon-xs"\n              >\n                <InfoIcon />\n              </InputGroupButton>\n            </TooltipTrigger>\n            <TooltipContent>\n              <p>Password must be at least 8 characters</p>\n            </TooltipContent>\n          </Tooltip>\n        </InputGroupAddon>\n      </InputGroup>\n      <InputGroup>\n        <InputGroupInput placeholder="Your email address" />\n        <InputGroupAddon align="inline-end">\n          <Tooltip>\n            <TooltipTrigger asChild>\n              <InputGroupButton\n                variant="ghost"\n                aria-label="Help"\n                size="icon-xs"\n              >\n                <HelpCircle />\n              </InputGroupButton>\n            </TooltipTrigger>\n            <TooltipContent>\n              <p>We&apos;ll use this to send you notifications</p>\n            </TooltipContent>\n          </Tooltip>\n        </InputGroupAddon>\n      </InputGroup>\n      <InputGroup>\n        <InputGroupInput placeholder="Enter API key" />\n        <Tooltip>\n          <TooltipTrigger asChild>\n            <InputGroupAddon>\n              <InputGroupButton\n                variant="ghost"\n                aria-label="Help"\n                size="icon-xs"\n              >\n                <HelpCircle />\n              </InputGroupButton>\n            </InputGroupAddon>\n          </TooltipTrigger>\n          <TooltipContent side="left">\n            <p>Click for help with API keys</p>\n          </TooltipContent>\n        </Tooltip>\n      </InputGroup>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n
